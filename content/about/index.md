HEY!! its me. You were not expecting that, were you? Sorry for disappointing. Anyways, let me introduce myself. My name is Akshendra and I write about pages for other peoples' blog. No seriously! however I do this only part time.

Primarily, I work as a Backend Developer at [Quizizz.com](https://quizizz.com) (really amazing website <sup>no bias</sup>). I love music and I like to code things. I have build a few things which you can check out [here](/things), if you haven't already.

Finally, thanks for visiting. Have a nice day.
